# Write a function called blend.
# It should take all the smoothie ingredients and chop up and mix all the characters
# and output a mixed string of characters
# Be sure to remove the spaces, as we don't want any air bubbles in our smoothie!

def blend(smoothie_ingredients)
end

# create a class called Blender
# It should have a method that takes an array of ingredients and returns a mixed string of characters.
