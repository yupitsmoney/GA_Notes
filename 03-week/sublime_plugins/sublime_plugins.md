# Sublime Plugins

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to:

- Make their favorite text editor, Sublime Text 3, more productive.

## Roadmap

1. Install _Package Control_
2. Install Basic Packages
3. Browse and Install Optional Packages
4. Learn Sublime Text Shortcuts

## 1. Install _Package Control_

It's possible to install optional packages into Sublime Text by downloading them and copying them into appropriate folders.  However, there's a better way to install and manage packages - _Package Control_.

[Installation Instructions](https://packagecontrol.io/installation)

After installed, press ```Cmd+Shift+P```, and start typing 'package control' to see all of the options.

### From this point forward...

...you should use _Package Control_ to install additional packages by typing ```Cmd+Shift+P``` then type 'pi' to highlight _Package Control: Install Package_.

You will then be presented with a list of all registered packages currently not installed on your system.

Select the package you wish to install and press ```enter```.

__Not all ST2 packages will work with ST3, so be sure to select ST3 packages as your first choice.__

## 2. Optional Packages

### _SideBar Enhancements_

__Note: For ST3 only__

[_SideBar Enhancements_]() will enhance your sidebar with options for a multitude of file & folder management options and other more advanced features.

### Emmet

If you code much HTML or CSS, [Emmet](http://emmet.io/) (formally known as Zen Coding) rocks!

After installation, create a new html file and type `html:5` and press `tab` - there's your html boilerplate.  But that's just for starters!

### JavaScript Linters

A linter checks for syntax errors and other flaws in your code.

There are several available, the one I use is [JSHint Gutter](https://github.com/victorporof/Sublime-JSHint).

Lint your JavaScript by pressing `Cmd+Shift+J`.  Fix errors, then press `Cmd+Shift+J` again and repeat until errors are gone.

Always lint your code before loading/refreshing your app!

See the documentation on how to configure the `.jshintrc` file to ignore globals like `angular`, etc.

## 3. Browse and Install Optional Packages

Packages, like many things in life, are a matter of personal choice.

Google 'sublime text plugins`, and you will see plenty of blog posts highlighting Sublime plugins like Color Pickers, etc.

Research, install and test drive packages at will.

If you don't like a package, it's as easy to remove it using Package Control as it was to install it.

## 4. Learn Sublime Text Shortcuts

Sublime Text has a ton of useful keyboard shortcuts built-in that will make you a more productive coder.  There are many articles and videos out there so be sure to check them out.  Also, be sure to find your favorite cheat sheet. Here are a couple of links to get your search started:
