#Calculator Lab

	Let's create a calculator using the OOP principles that we learned this week!
	
	This calculator can be: 1) a regular calculator, 2) finance calculator, 3) tip calculator, or anything you can imagine!

###Requirements:

- Must be built using Object-Oriented Principle (OOP)
- It must have a Graphic User Interface (GUI)
- Use HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Use best practices: whitespacing, commenting, DRY, separation of concerns, etc.


You have tonight to accomplish it! We will tag back up tomorrow to present your calculator app!
