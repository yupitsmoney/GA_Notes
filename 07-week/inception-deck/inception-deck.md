### What's an Inception Deck?

The Inception Deck is an agile development process that provides the who, what, why, where, when & size for a new project.

The purpose of the Inception Deck is to:

- Eliminate confusion and misunderstanding about a project's goals
- Set expectations for the project
- Highlight challenges the project may face
- Create alignment of the team's members

### Review the 10 Steps of the Inception Deck

#### 1. Why we are here?

Explain why the team is doing this project in the first place.

What's the purpose of the project?

#### 2. Create an Elevator Pitch!

An _Elevator Pitch_ is a concise description of a project or product that can be explained in about the amount of time it takes to ride in an elevator (approximately 30 seconds).

A good elevator pitch brings clarity and forces the team to think like the customer.

Your project's elevator pitch should be guided by this model:

> For [target customer]<br>
who [statement of need or opportunity]<br>
the [product name]<br>
is a [product category]<br>
that [key benefit, compelling reason to buy].<br>
Unlike [primary competitive alternative]<br>
our product [statement of differentiation].

An example:

> For the elderly who are afraid of technology, the _Gamebox 9000_ is a game system that both they and their grandchildren will love! Unlike the Xbox, et al., our system costs only $50 and is so intuitive, a grandmother can play it!

#### 3. Design a Product Box

What would the box that your product ships in look like?

Does the design capture the feeling or value of your product?

Does it contain a catchy slogan that helps others remember your product?

#### 4. The **NOT** List

The Not List defines the boundaries of your project.

The Not List actually has three lists:

- The things that are __IN__ (main features and concepts/technologies of your project).
- The things that are __OUT__ (those that didn't make the cut).
- The things that are unresolved or undecided.

#### 5. Meet your neighbors

Besides the core team, define who the other stakeholders are.

Identify your project's community.  Are there people or groups that you will need to interact with before your goes live (DBA's, technical writers, investors, etc.)?

#### 6. Show the solution

Provide a high-level blueprint of the technical architecture of the solution.

The solution's architecture will show the big components of the system and how they are related.

#### 7. What is going to keep you up at night?

Talking about the risks help build awareness of the challenges the project faces right from the start.

What are you project's key challenges and risks with respect to the technologies, team's skill-set and stakeholders?

#### 8. Size it up!

Define the projects main tasks and outline them along a timeline.

Typical tasks will include your key user stories and development processes such as wireframes, testing, etc.

#### 9. Be clear on what's going to give

In a perfect world, there would be enough time and money to produce a feature rich project of the highest quality.

Sadly, this is rarely the case, thus a compromise will exist between these four components:

- Time  
- Budget  
- Scope  
- Quality

The decisions you make can be visualized using four sliders representing the priority of each of the four components above.

In your project 3, both time and budget are inflexible and of highest priority.  You will need to determine the ratio between the other two, Scope & Quality.

#### 10. What's it going to take?

Having decided the vision and scope of the project, the final thing to do is to state how you are going to achieve the goals you have presented.

Typically, the details regarding time and money are more relevant, but since they are pre-determined in your project, you only need to address the goals with respect to your team members (and stakeholders that you may have).

Outline the key roles required to make your project a reality and identify who will perform each role.

## Practice

Lets practice writing an Inception Deck.  Get into your Project 3 teams and whiteboard decks.

This is only for practice, it does not have to be your "real" project. But if you think it might be your "real" project, be sure to take a picture because the walls are cleaned at night!

Here's an example of a [cool Inception Deck presentation](https://prezi.com/ascavhl-zh8a/agile-inception-deck/).

Let's do this!
