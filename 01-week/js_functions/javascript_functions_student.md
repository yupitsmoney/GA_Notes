#JavaScript Functions 
We know you've already looked at functions while you were working through your pre-work, but we're gonna review everything you covered, and then some! Welcome to the world of JavaScript functions! [*Queue corny School House Rock song!*](`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODGA7ssL-6g`)

- Declare and call a basic funciton, a function that takes in information, and a function that calls another function from within.
- Explain the difference between and **function declaration** and a **function expression**

##Lesson Roadmap

- Introduce Lesson
	- Overview Lesson Roadmap
	- Review Previous JS materials
- What the heck is a function?
	- Explain what a funciton is.
	- Show a simple pre-written function to the class.
- Declare a simple function (similar to the one you just showed the class) all together with the students!
	- Break down each piece of **declaring** the function and then **calling** the function, making sure to use correct technical terms (function keyword, function name, code to be executed in the curlies).
- GO over pre-written example of a function that has **parameters**.
- Write a function which takes **parameters**.
- Lab!

##Essential Questions
1. **Q:** Why are functions important to use? **A:** Functions are reusable, and keep your code DRY & organized; more answers etc...
2. **Q:** What's the difference between a *parameter* and an *argument*? **A:** When a function that needs information is declared, the items inside of the parantheses (immediatley after the function name) are paramenters, as are those same items inside of the curlies. The parameters are used like variables within your function. When you *call* a function that needs information, the informtion you pass into the function (or parens) are *arguments*.
