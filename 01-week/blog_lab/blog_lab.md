# Wireframing

## What are Wireframes?

### A wireframe is a basic visual representation of the elements of a single web page.

### Two general styles

- Low Fidelity

  A rough sketch showing the general size and layout of the elements of the page.
  
  Does not show typography, color, etc.  Images are typically displayed as placeholders.

- Hi-Fi

   A high fidelity wireframe includes a higher level of detail and is basically "neater".  It's not uncommon to show font styles, sizes, etc.  However, color is usually not included.
   
   Generally created using tools such as *Balsamiq* or, the new kid on the block, *sketch*.
   
**Google images of wireframe examples**

## Why Use Wireframes?

- Using wireframes simplifies communication between developers and clients; or even between the devs themselves.

  The lack of detail allows the developer to focus the client's attention on the "big picture", otherwise they may want to argue about details that don't matter at this point like what color a particular element should be...

- The final wireframe becomes a "blueprint" for building the HTML and CSS.

## Typical Workflow

1. Complete a low-fi sketch.
2. Continue to evolve each page in low-fi mode.
3. Transition to a hi-fi mock up after the low-fi is fleshed out.
4. Code the HTML/CSS!

# HTML/CSS *bighippo* Blog Lab

### Lets get into groups of 3 and whiteboard a wireframe of the homepage of a blog dedicated to *bighippo* enthusiasts!

### After the wireframe is complete, do the following:
- Take a picture of your wireframe if you expect to continue working on your blog after the end of this lesson - the whiteboards are cleaned nightly!
- Create a directory named *bighippo_blog* for your project.
- Create an *index.html* for your HTML.
- Create a directory named *css* and create a *styles.css* stylesheet inside of it.
- Create a directory named *images* to hold any images that you decide to include in your project.
- Write HTML and CSS using your wireframe as the blueprint.
- Since CSS positioning has not been covered in detail, do your best to use *margin*, *width*, *height*, *padding* and *border* to size elements and create space between them. Remember, most elements are block elements and will stack vertically.  If you want block elements to be adjacent to each other, look into the *float* CSS property.
